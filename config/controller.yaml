# Matrix Controller Configuration
# GPIO pins and behavior settings

# Button GPIO pins (pressed = connect to GND, pull-up enabled)
buttons:
  start_pin: 18      # GPIO pin for START button
  stop_pin: 19       # GPIO pin for STOP button
  debounce_ms: 80    # Debounce time in milliseconds

# Relay/SSR control
relay:
  pin: 20            # GPIO pin for relay control
  active_high: true  # true = HIGH turns relay ON, false = LOW turns relay ON

# UPS monitoring
ups:
  mode: "gpio"       # "disabled" or "gpio"
  mains_lost_pin: 21 # GPIO pin for UPS mains-lost signal (only used if mode=gpio)
  edge: "rising"     # "rising" or "falling" - which edge triggers shutdown
                     # Typically: rising = mains lost, falling = mains restored

# LED service
led_service:
  name: "matrix-led.service"  # Systemd service name

# Logging
logging:
  level: "INFO"      # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
